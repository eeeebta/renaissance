From the Tommy Wright III Mac-T Dog & Princess Loko sample of “Still Pimpin” introducing the album to the dark reggaeton & afrobeat’s infused beat illustrating the sonic landscape for the album. Beyoncé states out the gate that she will not be stopped 25 years in the game exploring her unwanted claim to power that has arose not from material possession or her husband but because she is ‘that girl.\nShe would also make reference to the opening track on “ALIEN SUPERSTAR” with the lyrics embedded in the chorus: “I’m too classy for this world forever I’m that girl Feed you diamonds and pearls ooh baby”. As well as track 10 “MOVE” where Tems’s sings “Who this girl in the back of the room? It’s the groove it’s the Yoncé groove”.

She is one the most-awarded female artists of all time. In 2021 she broke the record at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony for both the most awarded and the most nominated singer in Grammy’s history with 28 Grammys won and total of 79 nominations. In 2012 she was third on VH1’s list of 100 Greatest Women In Music. She was also recognized by many other societies for her contribution in music humanitarian effort and philanthropy. After everything she achieved in her career Beyoncé rightfully earned a nickname Queen B. With the success she accumulated over the years Beyoncé can easily say for herself that she’s one of the greatest of all time. She knows that what she accomplished is far greater from the average human so she is defining her superstardom as being extraterrestrial out of this world.

With Nile Rodgers on guitar & Raphael Saadiq on drums & bass the song breathes undeniable elements of the late ‘70s an the early '90s.

This also marks the first collaboration between BEAM & Beyoncé although BEAM lends additional vocals on “HEATED” & “CUFF IT”.\nThe track boasts several beat changes in which the second change pays homage and similarity to “Don’t Jealous Me” off the Beyoncé-produced and curated album The Lion King: The Gift. The backend of the song overlays the vocal sample of Big Freedia’s “Explode” used in “BREAK MY SOUL” to create a seamless transition.\nThe song stirred up controversy before its release on July 29 2022 when the composer credits were released showing Kelis as a writer for “ENERGY” as it interpolated her hit “Milkshake”.\nThis took Kelis by surprise as beforehand nobody had notified her that her song was going to be interpolated on “ENERGY”. While this is mainly the cause of a contract Kelis had signed when she was still new and young in the industry that in the end gave her nearly no say in the ownership of her own songs she was still disappointed in Beyoncé for not contacting her personally. On the 3rd of August following Kelis' vocal displeasure on social media Beyoncé updated the track on all streaming services removing the interpolation of “Milkshake”.

Heavily sampling Robin S.’s 1990 dance hit “Show Me Love” the song borrows inspiration from the genre. Also featuring additional vocals and another sample from bounce legend Big Freedia and her 2014 record “Explode.”The house production was handled by Beyoncé herself and R&B and pop icons Tricky Stewart and The-Dream—who teased his inclusion on the track via Twitter. The track released early on both Tidal—which Beyoncé part owns—and YouTube. On July 21 an instrumental and acapella version of the song were subsequently released.

While the Southern Hip-Hop influence are found in the catchy chorus & post-chorus similar to 7/11 off Beyoncé’s 2013 Self-Titled. The Southern Hip-Hop instrumentation is further evident in the sample of “Drag Rap” by The Showboys that appears throughout the chorus & post-chorus. Chicago Hip-Hop elements are delivered in classic No I.D. fashion taking an 80’s gospel track looping & flipping the track to provide a rebirth and modern interpretation on Beyoncé’s RENAISSANCE. This also marks the third collaboration with No I.D. and first as a lead artist after “Family Feud” with JAY-Z & “See Me Now” with Kanye West Big Sean & Charlie Wilson.

Beyoncé’s zodiac sign is a Virgo since she was born on September 4.\nAs one of the three earth signs who are considered the most grounded out of them all Virgos' sex life rely heavily on physical touch and closeness to someone. They are known to be really lusty sensual have high libido and are considered best in bed when they’re with someone they love trust and have some sort of connection with. Even though Virgos are considered patient lovers Bey’s expressing the tension she feels as she can’t wait no more. She and her lover don’t have time like they used to so she’s calling him to come as her excitement is getting bigger and taking over her. This is the third time Beyoncé is mentioning Virgo in her music previously done on her debut album Dangerously in Love with track 14 called “Gift from Virgo” and mentioning the sign in her song “Signs.”

This is also the first collaboration between Beyoncé Grace Jones & Tems and the first song on a Beyoncé studio album to feature two female artists.\nThe hard-hitting constant bass and chant-like chorus electrifies the listener into a rhythm that details Beyoncé & her girls looking for space on the dancefloor.

The Drake demo was partially leaked on the 19th of June 2022 rumored to feature Beyoncé. It was unknown at the time if the song would be released until the RENAISSANCE tracklist and writing credits were unveiled showing a Drake writing credit. “HEATED” would mark the second collaboration between the two stars since 2013’s “Mine”.

The track talks about having accentuating body features as well as mentioning her exuberant wealth over a dark trap-infused hip-house beat with elements similar to Billie Eilish’s “Bad Guy” with production credits from Beyoncé herself frequent collaborator Hit-Boy & Stuart White and first-time production collaboration with LilJuMadeDaBeat.

(I love it)\nI try to get all up in your mind\nIt stops at a crime and I'm gonna make you mine\nI try to get all up in your mind\nBe careful what you ask for 'cause I just might comply\n\n,“ALL UP IN YOUR MIND” flows directly from “THIQUE” sonically by way of the outro and thematically as Beyoncé states at the end of “THIQUE” that she is all up in JAY-Z’s mind due to the features and money she possesses.\nThe uncontrollable force that Beyoncé is alluded to on the track is matched by Beyoncé experimintation with new genres of Hyperpop that are affirmed through the writing credits illumining “A. G. Cook’s” assistance who helped usher in the popularity of hyperpop.

Kilo Ali’s 1990 track “America Has A Problem (Cocaine).” got sampled in this song. The story revolves around cocaine and the ups and downs it brings through the metaphor of a woman. Here Bey is that woman and she’s noting all of the qualities she has that make her partner addicted to her making him come back to her over and over again to get more of it.

The latter of the two features Beyoncé exploding into a 1970s disco tune with lush harmonies floating over vocals commanding that you will be stuck in the honey that is Beyoncé’s love. The outro sample of Moi Renee’s “Miss Honey” at the end of “HONEY” was found by Beyoncé herself as The-Dream explained on a series of tweets after the album was released explaining the creative process. “PURE” is an ode to ballroom vouge & house from the cadence of the chorus to the continuous sample of Kevin Aviance’s October 1996 track “Cunty” & Mike Q’s featuring Kevin Jz Prodigy’s song “Feels Like” throughout the track where Beyoncé flaunts her technique and the cost to look that good.

Beyoncé states in the last track of the album that the message being portrayed is a celebration rebirth & innovation of past sounds (such as disco house vogue & ballroom) that were founded by artists as – for example – Donna Summer.
